Nightingale Cipher

=================================================
DESCRIPTION:
=================================================
To be added...

=================================================
Insert into OpenSSL and OpenSSL's EVP
=================================================
1) Download...
	OpenSSL: 	wget https://github.com/openssl/openssl/archive/master.zip
	Nightingale:	wget https://github.com/rschmicker/Encryption/archive/master.zip

2) Move some files around...
	a) nightgale folder under Nightingale/openssl_migration to openssl/crypto/
	b) e_night.c under Nightingale/openssl_migration to openssl/crypto/evp
	c) nightgale.h under Nightingale/openssl_migration to openssl/include/openssl

3) Time to edit some files...
	a) crypto/evp/build.info to include compiling of e_night.c
	b) crypto/evp/c_allc.c to include loading of cipher:
		EVP_add_cipher(EVP_nightgale());
		EVP_add_cipher_alias(SN_nightgale, "nightgale");
	c) crypto/objects/objects.txt to include nightgale cipher before aes as such around line 864:
		#Nightgale
				: NIGHTGALE : nightgale
	d) Configure in openssl directory to include nightgale in compilation as such around line 315:
		"md2", "md4", "md5", "nightgale", "sha",
	e) util/mkdef.pl to include header file for nightgale as such around line 270:
		$crypto.=" include/openssl/nightgale.h";
	f) include/openssl/evp.h to add in EVP_nightgale() as such around line 727:
		const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_nightgale(void);

4) Let's give it a test!
	a) move compile_night_evp_test.sh and compile_night_test.sh to the root directory of OpenSSL
	b) edit make -j <thread count> in both scripts to account for your number of threads
	c) make excutable with chmod
	d) run 'em both!
